The initial step in selecting open datasets to use is finding which datasets are available. 

Open data are available from different kinds of sources, including goverment agencies, municipalities, companies, other oranizations, and from crowd-sourcing. 

## Where to start looking

A good starting point to locate datasets are in open data catalogues and portals. 

In Norway, the following catalogues and portals are good soures:
- [Norways official catalog for open data from public sector](https://data.norge.no/)
- [National Data Dictionary - Felles datakatalog (Beta version)](https://fellesdatakatalog.brreg.no)
- [Map catalogue](https://www.geonorge.no/en/)
- [Urbalurba's portal for Norwegian smart city data](http://www.urbalurba.no)
- [Stavanger municipality open data portal](https://open.stavanger.kommune.no)

As datasets can be registered in more than one catalogue, there is substatial overlap in the cataloges mentioned above. 

International sources:
- [European Data Portal](https://www.europeandataportal.eu)
- [INSPIRE Geoportal for European spatial data](http://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/discovery/)
- [UK open government data](https://data.gov.uk)
- [US open government data](https://www.data.gov)

Unfortunately, the catalogues do not cover all available data. If you do not find a specific data set, it can still be worth to seach for the data in other ways (e.g. through Google, or by visiting the web pages or contacting the organization you are looking for data from).
