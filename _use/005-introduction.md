These pages provides information for innovators and developers on various aspects of using open data. 

The pages are currently based on literature surveys on the barriers to publication and use of open data, and on an initial analysis of tasks involved when innovating and developing with open data. The pages will continiously be enhanced as more feedback and experiences is collected.

Many of the barriers and issues that users of open data experience have to be mitigated by the publishers. Thus, we have addressed the [barriers and actions to be taken](/publish/barriers-users) in the part of the open data lab that is targeting the publishers.

To help us understand more of your callanges with using open data, please [respond to our survey](/news/survey)!
