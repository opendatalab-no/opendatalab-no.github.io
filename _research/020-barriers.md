A central research topic within open data is barriers for publication and barriers for use of open data.

The research literature has so far focused most on the barriers to publication, while barriers to use seem to have received less focus. To facilitate innovation based on open data, it is important to understand both publication and use barriers, and to provide support for how to overcome these.

A summary of some central barriers for [publication of open data](/publish/barriers/) and for [users of open data](/publish/barriers-users/) is provided under our pages for [publishers of open data](/publish/intro).
