These pages provides information about research on open data, including research publishing and using open data. 

The pages are established by SINTEF, and describe more about topics of research addressed by our research projects and related research. The content will emerge over time with our research and when new knowledge is established. 

To help us understand more of your challenges with using open data, please [respond to our survey](/news/survey)!
