SINTEF is research partner in two new research projects related to open data.

SamÅpne is an innovation project under FORKOMMUNE, a Programme for Research and Innovation in the Municipal Sector of the Research Council of Norway. The goal of the project is to contribute to establising cost effective and standardised processes for opening and managment of open data with innovation potential, and to "crack the code" on how to facilitate innovation and business development through cocreation based on open data. Project partners are the municipalities of Trondheim and Bodø, while several other municipalites have joined as followers of the project.

ReiseNavet is an innovation project under the Transport 2025 programme of the Research Council of Norway. The theme of the project is Mobility as a Service (Maas). The project goal is to establish knowledge on how a national, digital platform for MaaS can provide effective and flexible support and lower the threshold for realisation of MaaS. Project participants are Entur, SINTEF, Ruter, Kolombus, Hertz, Hyre and Urban Sharing. 

Both projects will contribute to new knowledge on open data that will be used to further update OpenDataLab.
