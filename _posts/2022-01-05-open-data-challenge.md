In addition, there will be inspiring speeches on the possibilities for business development based on open data. The participants in the group can meet physically or digitally to work on the challenges during the event. 

Open Data Challenge 2022 is organized by [SamÅpne](https://xn--sampne-kua.no/) project, which is a collaboration between SINTEF, Trondheim municipality, Bodø municipality, follower cities and business actors.

## Theme 2022: Use of energy data to understand or prepare new business models based on open data. 

### Challenge 1
We want to use available data to gain insight into the energy consumption pattern. This can support the planning of measures to reduce energy consumption and peaks in energy consumption. 

### Challenge 2
To achieve the climate goals and become a zero-emission society, we must produce more renewable energy and, at the same time, use it smarter and more efficiently. Development of technologies such as solar power, smart homes and batteries is going at a furious pace, but adoption is still too slow. How can we use the available data to help people make smart choices for the future and their wallets?

## Who can participate?
Everyone is welcome! Start-ups, students, public actors and business actors who want to work with this year's theme.
