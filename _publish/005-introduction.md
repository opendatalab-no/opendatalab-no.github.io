These pages provides information about publishing of open data. The pages are mainly organized around tasks that are usually part of the process of publishing open data. 

The pages are estabilished by SINTEF, and focus on topics adressed by research projects. The content will therefore emerge over time as new knowledge is established. The current pages are based on an initial analysis of tasks involved in publishing and using of open data.

Where suggestions and solutions are provided by other sources, we refer to these and sometimes give a brief summary.

## Barriers to overcome

Research has surveyed barriers regarding the opening of data. The main barriers are: [^1]

- Public data owners lack awareness and knowledge about the benefits of open data, such as increased service quality, increased transparency and trust by citizens, active citizenship through a higher participation in political and public debates, and actual cost savings through the generation of economic activities and better services.

- Public data owners are concerned about economic issues such as the costs of opening data and the lack of business models, and they are uncertain on the extent and nature of return of investment. They do not see the value of the benefits listed above.

- The management of heterogeneous conditions of reuse of data is very challenging, and legal issues such as privacy is also a concern. Data is not published if the implications on privacy is unclear.

- Data owners have responsibility concerns and tend to have risk adverse cultures. They are concerned about what the use of the data may lead to, and thus they think that access to data should be restricted. Data owners also fear that the opening of data will increase the demand for better data quality, more stability in data availability, more user-friendly user interfaces, etc.
