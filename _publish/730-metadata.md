Published open data is described using a set of metadata, i.e., data that provide information about the datasets. Examples of metadata include short description in natural language, keywords/themes, data quality, data freshness (how often data is updated), data source (who published data), data format and other characteristics of the dataset.  



## Challenges 

### Provide accurate and useful metadata to increase discoverability, sharing and reuse of data.





## Suggestions


**Use DCAT**

[Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/) provides standard vocabularies for describing datasets in data catalogues. DCAT application profile [(DCAT-AP)](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/release/dcat-ap-v11) is used for data protals in Europe. 

In Norway we have an adapted Norwegian version: [**DCAT-AP-NO**](https://doc.difi.no/dcat-ap-no/)

### Tools

[**CKAN plugin for DCAT**](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-dcat)
