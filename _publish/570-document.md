The documentation provided with open data and APIs is important both to developers that try to understand how to use your data, and to innovators who take the decision on whether your data can be used at all.


## Challenges

Both for innovators and developers, it is important to quickly be able to determine whether the data and API is useable for their purpose. 


## Suggestions

- Provide a brief overview that explains what the data is and is not.
- Help innovators and developers to quickly determine whether your data is useable for them, so keep an intoductory part short and to the point.
- Remember that your reader may not be an expert in the domain of the data, so include enough context to make it understandable.

### OpenAPI

For documenting APIs, [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org) provides a  can be useful. 
As described at, the specification *"defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic."* [^1] 


OpenAPI descriptions can be created either by writing  by either writing 


### Tools

At [swagger.io](https://swagger.io) you will find links to both open source and commercial tools for documenting with OpenAPI and for using OpenAPI descriptions as part of your development projects.
