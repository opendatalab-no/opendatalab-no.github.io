The license selected for publishing data is important both for the owner and the user of the data, as it determines what the users are allowed to do with the data.

When selecting a license, keep in mind what the users might want to use the data for. While you may want to protect yourself from misuse, it is also important that the license is open enough to encourage and support innovations built on the data. 

In Norway, the following license agreement can be used for open government data:
- [Norwegian License for Open Government Data (NLOD)](https://data.norge.no/nlod/en)
- [NLOD in Norwegian](https://data.norge.no/nlod/no)

## Other terms of use

In addition to the issues usually covered by the license, there are other terms of use that can be important for the user of the data to know.

Such issues include:
- what availability can you garantee (e.g. is the data available 24/7)
- is there any restrictions on the use of the data, like max number of requests or volum of data per hour, etc.
- how frequently is the data updated?

Terms like the ones described above can determine whether it is possible to make sustainable solutions based on your data. The terms should be clearly described as part of the documentation of your dataset.
